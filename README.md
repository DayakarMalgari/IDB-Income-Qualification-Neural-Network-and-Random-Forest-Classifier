# IDB-Income-Qualification-Neural-Network-and-Random-Forest-Classifier
Neural Network and Random Forest Classifiers for Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Income Qualification Project

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
Income Qualification Project.

Models: 4 classes Classifiers of Random Forest and Deep Neural Network.

KFold Cross Validation, Data Balancing, Explorative Data Analysis, Feature Importance chart, 
Imputing, Outlier removal, Classification reports, Confusion Matrices and Roc Curves with Auc Values for all classes and both models.

Random Forest and Deep Neural Network both has accuracy around 99.70%

However, Deep Neural Network Predicted classes are better spreadout than Random Forest Predicted classes.
